Simple C program that tells you if your OS is reddit or not (aka do you use Fedora Linux)
If you do use Fedora, it auto-nukes your fedora install so you can use something better.

## WARNING
### THIS WILL NUKE YOUR FEDORA INSTALL. ONLY USE THIS IN A VM. IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOURE DOING, DON'T INSTALL THIS PROGRAM!
